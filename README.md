# MagickaBBS
Linux/FreeBSD bulletin board system

As I lost the code to my initail BBS flea, I've decided to start over from scratch and this time I'm using git hub so I dont
lose it again!

Magicka is meant to be a modern (haha) BBS system, using modern technologies, like Sqlite, XMPP, long filenames (gasp!) etc
while still retaining the classic BBS feel. ANSI & Telnet, and good old ZModem.

Currently it's in it's very early (re)development. You can sign up, login and log off. ie. Don't use it yet.

I plan to work on things in this order:

Mail System (using JAM LIB for compatability)
External Door Support
File Systems
Everything else..
