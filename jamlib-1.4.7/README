This is the JAMLIB library by Björn Stenberg with some minor modifications
made by Johan Billing and Sir Raorn. You can find the documentation for
JAMLIB in the file jamlib.doc.

These are the modifications done by Johan Billing:

 * Support for Win32 and Linux added

 * JAM_ReadMsgHeader() now gives the error JAM_NO_MESSAGE if the
   message has been removed from the messagebase (both offset and
   crc are -1 in the index file).

 * The function JAM_AddEmptyMessage() has been added

 * Improved ANSI-C compatibilty by changing the header files 
   included and using feof() to check for EOF.

 * JAMLIB been rewritten so that it no longer reads or writes structs
   directly from or to disk. This makes JAMLIB more portable and ensures
   that the Intel byte-order is used on all platforms.

 * Some other bugfixes

These are the modifications done by Sir Raorn:

 * All non-linux code dropped out (patches for mingw/djgpp/etc are welcome)

 * Moved to autoconf/automake/libtool

Have a nice programming! :-)
